# Book-Store
Online Bookstore implemented by javaFX

    ---This Application was implemented using offline XAMPP database.
* As OOP concepts were followed, you can change the host, password, and uri from the ConnectionEstablisher Class in the database package.
* you can add admins from the database directrly but useres are allowed to signup for new accounts freely.
* There is no need to create tables in the database, they are automatically created if the connection is established and 
* the writing permission to the database is granted
* no payment API implemented, every user gets 1000 EGP on signing up
